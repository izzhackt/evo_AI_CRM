## 2026-06-24 - Initial Launch Contract

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: baseline.
Affected plan section: all sections of `docs/EVO_LAUNCH_PLAN.md`.
Reason: user requested `/goal-plan-contract` as the first launch-control slice,
blocking implementation lanes.
Decision: create the launch plan contract, append-only change log, research
summary, acceptance criteria, file ownership, and merge order before coding.
Validation impact: docs-only slice still requires real repo validation through
`npm run lint`, `npx next typegen && npx tsc --noEmit`, and `npm run build`, or
an exact blocker report.
Reviewer notes: pending independent code-reviewer review.

## 2026-06-24 - Record Existing Validation Blockers

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: validation constraint.
Affected plan section: research summary, plan-slice acceptance criteria,
required validation commands.
Reason: real validation found an existing dependency security advisory and a
Next.js workspace-root warning after the launch contract was drafted.
Decision: document `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` as a required gate and
record that the current audit failure must be resolved in a future dependency or
security lane because the forced npm suggestion would install an incompatible
Next.js downgrade. Also record the Turbopack root warning as a future config
cleanup item.
Validation impact: lint, route/type validation, and build can pass; npm audit
currently exits non-zero due the existing Next/PostCSS advisory.
Reviewer notes: pending independent code-reviewer review.

## 2026-06-24 - Add Brand Research Lane

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: scope and merge order.
Affected plan section: goal slice, merge order, file ownership, launch acceptance.
Reason: user requested `/goal-brand-research` after the initial launch contract:
use public evoadmissions.com, amoCRM docs, and public study-abroad CRM patterns
to produce product copy, data model terms, realistic countries/program flows,
and source-backed UX requirements.
Decision: set the current contract slice to `/goal-brand-research` and insert a
docs-only `brand-research` lane immediately after `plan-contract` and before
implementation lanes. The lane owns `docs/EVO_BRAND_RESEARCH.md`; it may update
this change log only for discovered scope or validation constraints and must not
modify runtime app code.
Validation impact: run real repo validation after the docs change:
`npm run lint`, `npx next typegen && npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and
`npm audit --audit-level=moderate` with any blocker reported exactly.
Reviewer notes: pending independent code-reviewer review.

## 2026-06-24 - Add Architecture Contract Lane

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: scope, architecture, acceptance criteria, file ownership, and merge order.
Affected plan section: goal slice, research summary, acceptance criteria, file
ownership, merge order, required validation commands.
Reason: user requested `/goal-architecture`: redesign app architecture around
roles, routes, domain entities, amoCRM adapter contract, student portal
contract, and prepared AI contract.
Decision: add an `architecture-contract` lane after docs/research planning and
before runtime behavior hardening. This lane owns schema/interface decisions and
adds compile-checked TypeScript contract modules without claiming live amoCRM,
student portal, or Anthropic integration success.
Validation impact: run the real repo validation gates after implementation:
`npm run lint`, `npx next typegen && npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and
`npm audit --audit-level=moderate`; report any exact blocker rather than
substituting mocks or fake integration success.
Reviewer notes: pending independent code-reviewer review.

## 2026-06-24 - Add Prepared AI Prompts Lane

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: scope, architecture, acceptance criteria, file ownership, and merge order.
Affected plan section: goal slice, execution rules, file ownership, merge order,
presentation-readiness.
Reason: user requested `/goal-ai-prompts`: build a prepared-response AI layer
for the first presentation, including a prompt library, response scenarios, an
AI drawer, a WhatsApp/reply generator, and a deterministic streaming UI.
Decision: set the current contract slice to `/goal-ai-prompts` and add a narrow
implementation lane before broader runtime integration work because the user
explicitly requested prepared responses for the first presentation. The lane may
create or edit `src/lib/prepared-ai.ts`,
`src/components/PreparedAiDrawer.tsx`, `src/components/WaReplyBox.tsx`,
`src/app/(staff)/whatsapp/[id]/page.tsx`, and `src/lib/whatsapp.ts` only for the
minimal truthfulness guard that prevents missing WhatsApp credentials from being
reported as demo send success. It must use real conversation/lead data from the
current repo, must stay deterministic, must be gated by the prepared-AI contract
to first-presentation mode, and must not route prepared responses through the
live Anthropic endpoints or imply live WhatsApp delivery success.
Validation impact: run the real repo gates after implementation:
`npm run lint`, `npx next typegen && npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and
`npm audit --audit-level=moderate`; report exact blockers for any non-zero gate.
Reviewer notes: first independent code-reviewer review requested changes for
plan freshness, append-only ordering, WhatsApp demo-send truthfulness, and the
dirty baseline commit boundary.

## 2026-06-24 - Approve Separate Baseline Commit For Prepared AI

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: merge order and validation constraint.
Affected plan section: merge order, acceptance criteria, validation.
Reason: the prepared-AI slice depends on CRM runtime baseline files that were
not previously tracked, and a single baseline-plus-prepared-AI commit would make
slice review too broad and non-buildable from a clean checkout.
Decision: create a separate baseline commit first with only the pre-existing CRM
runtime files required to make the app build from a clean checkout, then commit
the prepared-AI response workflow separately. Do not include prepared-AI files
or behavior in the baseline commit except inseparable runtime baseline.
Validation impact: run real lint, type/route validation, and production build
after the baseline commit; rerun the real validation gates after the prepared-AI
commit and report the existing audit blocker exactly.
Reviewer notes: user explicitly approved this commit order before the baseline
commit was created.

## 2026-06-24 - Add Admissions CRM Core Slice

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: scope, architecture, acceptance criteria, file ownership, and merge order.
Affected plan section: goal slice, merge order, file ownership, validation.
Reason: user requested `/goal-admissions-crm`: build the core staff CRM for
Command Center, Admissions Pipeline, Student 360, tasks, documents,
applications, and finance overview.
Decision: set the current contract slice to `/goal-admissions-crm` and add a
focused `admissions-crm-core` lane after the prepared-AI lane. The lane may edit
`docs/EVO_LAUNCH_PLAN.md`, `docs/PLAN_CHANGES.md`,
`src/app/(staff)/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/app/(staff)/sales/page.tsx`,
`src/app/(staff)/clients/page.tsx`, `src/app/(staff)/clients/[id]/page.tsx`,
`src/app/(staff)/tasks/page.tsx`, `src/app/(staff)/finance/page.tsx`,
`src/app/(staff)/layout.tsx`, `src/app/(staff)/applications/page.tsx`,
`src/app/(staff)/documents/page.tsx`, `src/lib/queries.ts`,
`src/lib/domain.ts`, `src/lib/i18n.ts`, and shared UI only if needed for these
surfaces. It must use the existing Next.js App Router, SQLite data, query
functions, and Server Actions; no hidden mocks, demo-only success paths, fake
integration claims, or data migration are part of this slice.
Validation impact: run the real repo gates after implementation:
`npm run lint`, `npx next typegen && npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and
`npm audit --audit-level=moderate`; report exact blockers for any non-zero gate.
Reviewer notes: pending independent code-reviewer review.

## 2026-06-24 - Include Shared CRM Server Action Hardening

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: file ownership and acceptance criteria.
Affected plan section: `/goal-admissions-crm` file ownership and validation.
Reason: the new global applications and documents queues submit through the
existing shared status Server Actions, so the slice needs those actions to
validate status input and revalidate the new queue routes.
Decision: add `src/lib/actions.ts` to the `/goal-admissions-crm` write set for
the narrow purpose of application/document status validation and route
revalidation. Do not add new mutation paths or fake persistence.
Validation impact: unchanged real repo gates:
`npm run lint`, `npx next typegen && npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and
`npm audit --audit-level=moderate`.
Reviewer notes: pending independent code-reviewer review.

## 2026-06-24 - Clarify Admissions CRM Acceptance Criteria

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: acceptance criteria.
Affected plan section: `/goal-admissions-crm` acceptance criteria.
Reason: the launch plan current slice and deliverables already name
`/goal-admissions-crm`, but the detailed slice acceptance section still carried
the prior prepared-AI slice checklist.
Decision: replace the stale prepared-AI slice checklist in
`docs/EVO_LAUNCH_PLAN.md` with admissions CRM acceptance criteria for Command
Center, Admissions Pipeline, Student 360, global applications and documents
queues, tasks, finance, navigation, status actions, and real validation. This
does not add student-portal implementation; the student portal remains after the
CRM contracts stabilize.
Validation impact: unchanged real repo gates:
`npm run lint`, `npx next typegen && npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and
`npm audit --audit-level=moderate`.
Reviewer notes: pending independent code-reviewer review.

## 2026-06-24 - Expose Finance Overview Read-Only To Staff

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: acceptance criteria and role access.
Affected plan section: `/goal-admissions-crm` staff finance overview surface.
Reason: independent reviewer found that Command Center links exposed
`/finance` to all staff while the finance page redirected non-admin/non-finance
roles back to `/dashboard`, creating a broken route loop for the required CRM
finance overview.
Decision: make the finance overview route and navigation visible to staff as a
read-only CRM operating surface, while keeping payment mutation controls and
Server Actions restricted to admin and finance roles. This is not a broad role
model redesign and does not add student-portal or external integration work.
Validation impact: rerun real gates after the access correction:
`npm run lint`, `npx next typegen && npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, built
app authenticated smoke, and `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` with the
existing advisory reported exactly.
Reviewer notes: addresses first independent code-reviewer `changes_requested`.
