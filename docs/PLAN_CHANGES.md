# Plan Changes

This file is append-only. Do not rewrite or delete earlier entries.

Before coding, add an entry here when any of these change:

- Scope.
- Architecture.
- Acceptance criteria.
- File ownership.
- Merge order.
- Validation requirements.
- External credentials, services, or deployment assumptions.

## 2026-06-24 - Initial Launch Contract

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: baseline.
Affected plan section: all sections of `docs/EVO_LAUNCH_PLAN.md`.
Reason: user requested `/goal-plan-contract` as the first launch-control slice,
blocking implementation lanes.
Decision: create the launch plan contract, append-only change log, research
summary, acceptance criteria, file ownership, and merge order before coding.
Validation impact: docs-only slice still requires real repo validation through
`npm run lint`, `npx next typegen && npx tsc --noEmit`, and `npm run build`, or
an exact blocker report.
Reviewer notes: pending independent code-reviewer review.

## 2026-06-24 - Record Existing Validation Blockers

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: validation constraint.
Affected plan section: research summary, plan-slice acceptance criteria,
required validation commands.
Reason: real validation found an existing dependency security advisory and a
Next.js workspace-root warning after the launch contract was drafted.
Decision: document `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` as a required gate and
record that the current audit failure must be resolved in a future dependency or
security lane because the forced npm suggestion would install an incompatible
Next.js downgrade. Also record the Turbopack root warning as a future config
cleanup item.
Validation impact: lint, route/type validation, and build can pass; npm audit
currently exits non-zero due the existing Next/PostCSS advisory.
Reviewer notes: pending independent code-reviewer review.

## 2026-06-24 - Add Brand Research Lane

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: scope and merge order.
Affected plan section: goal slice, merge order, file ownership, launch acceptance.
Reason: user requested `/goal-brand-research` after the initial launch contract:
use public evoadmissions.com, amoCRM docs, and public study-abroad CRM patterns
to produce product copy, data model terms, realistic countries/program flows,
and source-backed UX requirements.
Decision: set the current contract slice to `/goal-brand-research` and insert a
docs-only `brand-research` lane immediately after `plan-contract` and before
implementation lanes. The lane owns `docs/EVO_BRAND_RESEARCH.md`; it may update
this change log only for discovered scope or validation constraints and must not
modify runtime app code.
Validation impact: run real repo validation after the docs change:
`npm run lint`, `npx next typegen && npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and
`npm audit --audit-level=moderate` with any blocker reported exactly.
Reviewer notes: pending independent code-reviewer review.

## 2026-06-24 - Add Architecture Contract Lane

Date: 2026-06-24, workspace timezone.
Author: Codex.
Change type: scope, architecture, acceptance criteria, file ownership, and merge order.
Affected plan section: goal slice, research summary, acceptance criteria, file
ownership, merge order, required validation commands.
Reason: user requested `/goal-architecture`: redesign app architecture around
roles, routes, domain entities, amoCRM adapter contract, student portal
contract, and prepared AI contract.
Decision: add an `architecture-contract` lane after docs/research planning and
before runtime behavior hardening. This lane owns schema/interface decisions and
adds compile-checked TypeScript contract modules without claiming live amoCRM,
student portal, or Anthropic integration success.
Validation impact: run the real repo validation gates after implementation:
`npm run lint`, `npx next typegen && npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and
`npm audit --audit-level=moderate`; report any exact blocker rather than
substituting mocks or fake integration success.
Reviewer notes: pending independent code-reviewer review.
