# AST-5 — portal functional parity receipts

## 2026-09-20 — iPhone operational stage

First block: display `student_portal_overview_v2.operational_stage` under case status. Same 11 standard translations and unknown-stage wording as web, complete RU/KY strings. Blank values are omitted. Failed refresh clears stale overview/actions and exposes existing retry state. No database/auth changes.

Real evidence: Xcode Simulator build succeeded using existing real Supabase config; installed without deleting app or QA session. Opened Home → My Admission with existing authenticated EVO QA Student. Real overview rendered the custom-stage label, curator and calm action state. Light screenshot and dark + maximum Dynamic Type inspected. Stage wraps; scrolling required at largest size. Existing long navigation title truncation is outside this change.

Command: `xcodebuild -project ios/EVOAdmissions.xcodeproj -scheme 'EVO admissions' -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=C3A01C7C-4C22-4DE8-8BD8-7DEC5F786FF2' -derivedDataPath .next/ios-build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=YES CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=- build`. Build log `.next/parity-proof/stage-build.log` is local.

Limits: only actual stage of existing QA case exercised; other stages verified against source dictionaries, no fabricated cases. KY source strings checked, KY render not exercised. No hardware, VoiceOver, injected network failure, product-wide E2E or production deployment claimed. Simulator restored to light / large.
